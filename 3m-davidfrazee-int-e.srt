1
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,640
Hi. Could you introduce yourself?

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,940
Yes. I'm David Frazee. I'm the General Manager and Vice President

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,426
of 3M's Digital Oral Care business.

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:15,673
So what do you do exactly?

5
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,366
So our business at 3M ESPE Dental,

6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,173
for my product category,

7
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,713
is for digital dentistry.

8
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:24,806
Or providing products that are used in the dentist's office,

9
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,326
or the orthodontist's office,

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,186
to do visualization and data capture and things like that,

11
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,073
to make impression taking much simpler

12
00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:34,560
than it has been in the past.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,593
And that leads to a whole bunch of opportunities in the future

14
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,700
with digital impression data,

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,366
to improve dentistry

16
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:44,753
by making new applications that, before this technology existed,

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,820
could not be done.

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,373
Can you describe the technology

19
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,406
and the product you're promoting?

20
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,980
The true definition scanner product

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,440
is a device that scans the teeth.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,760
It's very fast.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,560
It can take a digital impression in just a couple of minutes.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,973
That data is then captured and then analyzed

25
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:03,480
and then uploaded to the cloud.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,580
And from the cloud then,

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,146
the consumers of the data would be a dental lab,

28
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:08,500
or an orthodontic lab,

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,740
or some other way to manufacture something for dentistry

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,980
is then built using digital data as input.

31
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,500
For example with a CAD cam system, even in a lab.

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,966
So with the CAD cam system

33
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:22,480
you can almost perfectly design a custom crown,

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,886
for example, for a patient,

35
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:27,513
that can be manufactured using high-tech manufacturing things,

36
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:30,060
like milling or even 3D printing.

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,273
Then you can place that in the mouth on the next visit

38
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:35,953
and you're almost guaranteed to have a perfect fit.

39
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,593
And everybody wants to go to the dentist

40
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,553
and have everything happen smoothly.

41
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:42,360
So it's a great opportunity to improve oral care,

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,606
as well as make it easy on the patient and the dentist.

43
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,460
What does this replace?

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,233
What existing technology or product would it replace?

45
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:52,140
Probably for the last 80 years,

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,406
when you went to the dentist and had to have a crown,

47
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,360
or something like a crown, you would have that goo material,

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,786
and you bite down on it, for sometimes 5 minutes,

49
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,813
and then you'd pull it out of the mouth,

50
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:08,266
and that impression is used to create the rest of the restoration,

51
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,846
or some other measurements of the mouth,

52
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,573
for braces and things like that.

53
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:15,806
So rather than take that analog impression we call it,

54
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,873
let's digitize that at the beginning,

55
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:20,653
and make it all essentially automated.

56
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:23,540
And it relieved a lot of the stress and burden

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,153
of shipping things around and trying to keep track of it.

58
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:27,600
Let's just send it through the cloud,

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,513
and make it digital all the way, so take a scan,

60
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:34,866
and the next step might be that your restoration arrives

61
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,360
in the mail to the dentist's office and drops in,

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,013
that's the only thing ever created.

63
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,806
As opposed to these intermediate steps.

64
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,406
There's still a lot of value in that process,

65
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:46,660
but making a digital makes it better, faster, easier for everyone.

66
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,120
Now when most people think 3M they might think of

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,446
office, home supplies, so,

68
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,226
how many branches do you have

69
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,826
and how did this one start?

70
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,320
That's a great question. So,

71
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,453
3M is a 30 billion dollar plus company,

72
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:03,800
sells products all across the world

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,180
in all sorts of different divisions or sectors.

74
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,980
There's 5 major sectors,

75
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,720
and in fact the healthcare sector,

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
which is the business group where the dental division resides,

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,420
is over 5 billion dollars annually,

78
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,506
with products for operating rooms and products for doctor's offices,

79
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:24,013
but also the dental and orthodontic business.

80
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,753
So the dental and orthodontic business today

81
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,273
comprise about 1/3 of the healthcare business.

82
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,233
And it's a very prominent part of the portfolio for 3M

83
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,020
and the innovation that comes from the rest of the company

84
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,233
finds its way to dental very quickly and naturally in 3M.

85
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,233
Where are you currently marketing this

86
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,480
and do you have any globalization plans to market overseas?

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,026
We do.

88
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:49,686
The true definition scanner has been launched in the United States

89
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:50,980
for the last couple of years,

90
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,600
and is now in 4 or 5 of the major developed markets.

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,280
Western Europe, going to Japan later this year,

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,220
it's in Australia and New Zealand, it's in Canada.

93
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,273
So all of those have begun to come online

94
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,766
and we'll continue to expand that throughout the rest of the world

95
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,000
over the next couple of years.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,926
Great. How long have you been at 3M?

97
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,913
I've been at 3M 10 years this month.

98
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:14,546
And so, what all have you done there?

99
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:19,333
I joined 3M to run the corporate research lab for software electronics

100
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,153
and did that for about 5 years.

101
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:22,760
And then have worked in the dental business,

102
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,266
first in R&D and now in the business for the last 5.

103
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,713
Almost exclusively focused on

104
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:31,720
how do we make digital a more natural part of oral care,

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,466
and oral treatments,

106
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:37,726
and bring some of the cool mobile, cloud, visual technology,

107
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:41,173
into the dentist's office to make the care of patients

108
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,126
and the use by doctors.

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,180
Much easier, more natural.

110
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,213
Like the phones and the tablets and things like that.

111
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,700
Was your background in the healthcare industry?

112
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,506
I've been in the healthcare industry for my entire career.

113
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,760
In radiology business prior to this

114
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,180
and then in some other medical imaging applications,

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,646
including this one.

116
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,526
Very nice.

117
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:03,273
All right, well thank you very much. I appreciate it.

118
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,280
Yeah, thank you.

119
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,540
All right, thanks.
